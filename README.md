## Shibuya Comics WIP

A flutter app used to share art and comics to other users in our community.

# Still work in progress

Shibuya Comics is a mobile app developed for the community to post art, comics and travel picks. It is created 
to move content out of Discord and have an alternative, more dedicated and more reliable way to save and share content.

## Coming (for the community)
I'd like to make a React front end that would mimic the mobile app feel. It would make Shibuya Comics easily available for PC's and we'd finally get to use the shibuyacomics.com address!
A discord bot integration is coming! This will make it easier to create accounts and link them with your Discord accounts. Will also keep access limited to the community server members. 
Other neat features would be posting and sharing directly through Discord for ease of use.
